# Knowledge-and-perspectives-of-open-science-among-researchers-in-Ghana-West-Africa

## Brief description of the project
Open Science(OS) primarily aims at increasing the value and reliability of scientific output to guide innovation and development but African researchers who are mostly disadvantaged due to several reasons are likely not be actively involved in open science. This study  will therefore help understand the knowledge base and perspectives of open science among researchers in Ghana as well as the challenges they face and recommend possible interventions. More substantial data and evidence is needed to understand the level of adoption and practicality of open science in Ghana. The results of this project will help in establishing the current level of awareness of open science in Ghana and then recommend possible interventions to create an enabling environment for open science to thrive in Ghana. 

## Problem
The uptake and adoption of open science in Africa and for that matter, Ghana, has been low, denying researchers and the country in general benefits that the practices offers.

## Solution
This project therefore seeks to investigate the level of OS awareness among early career researcherrs in Ghana and the possible challenges they may  be facing. 
 
## Potential Methodology
This study will make use of a questionnaire that will be administered to general researchers(target audience) including students over a period of time to collect answers concerning their level of awareness and also the challenges they may be facing if they are actively practicing OS. The data generated will then be exported to an cloud saved excel sheet, analyzed and results discussed.
